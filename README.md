# COMP 472 - Project #3

Goal of the project is to code both unigram and bigram language identification systems. We are then required to input test sentences and put some output files in the log directory. View the following sections for examples, or information on running the application.

### Running the Application

To run the application, simply boot it up in your favourite Java IDE. A jar file may or may not be provided when the demo time comes.

## Usage

Below is a list of all the training files available in the `/texts` directory.

### English Texts

`en-moby-dick.txt`

`en-the-little-prince.txt`

### French Texts

### Portuguese Texts
